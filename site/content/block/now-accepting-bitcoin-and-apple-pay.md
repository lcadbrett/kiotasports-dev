As 2018 is upon us it only seems fitting to announce an update to our ability to process and accept different forms of payment. As of Jan 1 2018 Trestles Chiropractic is now equipped to accept payments in the form of Apple pay, Android pay, and Major E-currencies such as Bitcoin, Etherium, and Litecoin. As newer forms of payment gain popularity, and become accessible to small businesses, we will do our best to make sure these methods are available for co-payments and other transactions at Trestles Chiropractic.

We will still be accepting traditional forms of payment as well; cash, credit, and check.

Please do not hesitate to give us a call if you have any questions about this news.
