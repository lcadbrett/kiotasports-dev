What would your reaction be if you received a prescription and rather than seeing a medication listed it read **“Positive Mental Attitude, use daily as needed”?** I think most would not look at positivity as a means of solving their problems. However this can be exactly the case in many situations.

In an article on[](<>) [healthline](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/giving-thanks "Healthline") they cite an article by Robert Emmons, psychology professor at UC Davis, who has found through his research on **“positive psychology”** that those who adopt the **“attitude of gratitude”** mindset tend to do the following:

* take better care of themselves [](<>)[physically and mentally](worlds-oldest-gymnast-shows-how-stay-active-your-80s.html "physical care")
* engage in more protective health behaviors and maintenance
* get more regular[](<>) [exercise](power-power-walk.html "exercise")
* eat a healthier diet
* have improved mental alertness
* schedule wellness check-ups
* cope better with[](<>) [stress](stress-affects-your-quality-life.html "Stress") and daily challenges
* feel happier and more optimistic
* avoid problematic physical symptoms
* have[](<>) [stronger immune systems](diy-flu-shot-alternatives.html "immune system")
* maintain a brighter view of the future

In this[](<>) [San Clemente Chiropractic](../index.html "San Clemente Chiropractic") office we look beyond the outward symptoms that initially bring a patient to the office and search for what we call Subluxation. 3 factors that comprise subluxation are physical, emotional and chemical stressors. So negativity would fall into the emotional category. Getting control over a negative attitude can take away 1/3 of the emotional stress that can lead to other health related issues.

[](<>)[Trestles Chiropractic](http://www.trestleschiropractic.com/contact-us "Trestles Chiropractic") will continue to talk about Being Thankful for Health for the next 3 blog posts. So, follow along to learn how being grateful for what you have can help you be healthy!
