I had the opportunity this last weekend to go down to T-street where the [](<>)[Stoke-o-Rama competition](http://www.sanclementetimes.com/blog/2013/08/09/gudauskas-bros-stoke-o-rama-returns/ "Stoke-o-rama returns") was going on. This annual event is put on by San Clemente’s own Gudauskas brothers. Entry is free for the kids who participate in this event. And the money they raise from sponsors, sales of Tees, and donations goes towards helping children have access to swimming lessons. The local boys spent their day signing hats and commentating during the event. Patrick Gudauskas was well involved thought the day despite competing in the[](<>) [Hurley Pro at Lower Trestles](http://www.thehurleypro.com/ "The Hurley Pro") the following day. The positive vibes from the event were in full force this morning as Pat defeated Ace Buchnan to advance to the 3rd round.

This past Tuesday I had the opportunity to speak to a youth group that meets at[](<>) [Our Lady of Fatima](http://olfschool.net/ "Our lady of fatima") church on Tuesday nights. It was a great experience to be able to talk to these teenagers about some of the health issues that they face at this time in their lives, especially as we approach the [](<>)[Flu season](diy-flu-shot-alternatives.html "DIY flu shot alternatives"). The highlight of the night was the digital nerve scan demonstration. The kids and even the leaders of the group lined up to have their neck scanned. I was pretty shocking to see how much stress our youths’ nervous systems are. Many of these teens are already suffering from migraines or other muscular type issues in their shoulders.

The good news is that there are a number of resources for kids and teens in the city of San Clemente. It’s great to see the local celebrity types getting involved as well. It’s such a great example to the next generation of how to reach out to help others. If you would like to follow the Gudauskas brothers you can find them on twitter and instagram: [@patrickgud](https://twitter.com/Patrickgud "Patrick Gudauskas"), [@tannergud](https://twitter.com/tannergud "Tanner Gudauskas"), and[](<>) [@danedamus](http://instagram.com/danedamus# "Dane Gudauskas"). Also be sure to head down to Lowers and send Patrick positive energy and support for his next heats.

If you would like to have[](<>) [Dr Anderson](http://www.trestleschiropractic.com/meet-doctor "Meet The Doctor") donate his time by speaking to your business or youth group we would love to share our knowledge and expertise on health and[](<>) [wellness in the workplace](stress-affects-your-quality-life.html "Stress in the workplace") and the community.
