This morning I found a note on my desk from the other Chiropractor I work with. One of his patients is the son-in-law of an elderly patient that I have just recently begun to treat. The note informed me that my patient, I’ll call him Steve, had been using a cane to get around for the last year. Steve went on a 3 mile hike this past week and was excited to have left his cane at home. I have only adjusted Steve twice prior to this.

Steve is not the first case where I have seen someone experience drastic improvement following the initial adjustment. This is what drives me to keep doing what I do. It amazes me how the human body can continue to perform and function as it should when it is properly cared for. I am grateful to Steve’s Primary Physician for making the recommendation that he see a chiropractor.

While it would be easy for me to take the credit for what “I did”, with using [chiropractic](../index.html "San Clemente Chiropractic") to help Steve, I know deep down that my job is only to facilitate the body to heal itself. I simply find the areas that are in need of my expertise and use that knowledge and skill to allow the body and the power that made the body to work in that person. All too often we jump to the conclusion that healing must only come from the outside. This could not be further from the truth. Often healing is found within ourselves.

Keep in mind that not every patient I see and visit with experience this kind of immediate response to chiropractic. In most cases people see results in roughly 6-10 visits. Even though Steve has seen major improvement we still have a lot of work to do and we will continue to work together to get him to a place that he is happy with.

If you or someone you know has found themselves unable to perform like before. Or is frustrated with the limitations their body is putting on them, please do not hesitate to [](<>)[Ask The Doctor](../ask-doctor.html "Ask the Doctor") or come in for a[](<>) [complementary consultation](../index.html "complementary consultation") to see if Chiropractic can help you get your life back.
