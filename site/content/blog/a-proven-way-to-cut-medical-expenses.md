I recently posted an article I came across on the popular WebMD site talking about how[](<>) [chiropractic care can reduce the cost of medical expenses](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20041012/chiropractic-care-may-reduce-surgeries-x-rays "chiropractic care can reduce the cost of medical expenses") from several factors such as decreased need for surgery, and reduced cost of X-ray and MRI. I found this to be an interesting article which cited its information from a [research paper by Antonio P. Legorreta, MD et al.](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=217450 "JAMA") which analyzed annual expense on individuals with Low back pain over a 4 year period. Two groups were analyzed, one with and the other without access to chiropractic services.

The study found that Chiropractic care:

* Cut costs of Low back pain treatment by 28%
* Reduced need for hospitalization by 41%
* Reduced need for back surgeries by 32%
* Reduced the cost of medical imaging by 37%

Another interesting note that the article covers is that studies have shown that Chiropractic care has a [95% patient satisfaction](../node/5.html "success stories") rate. Many find satisfaction in care due to the personal, hands on attention they receive with a chiropractor as well as the success they find in reaching their goals in preventing and overcoming health complications.
