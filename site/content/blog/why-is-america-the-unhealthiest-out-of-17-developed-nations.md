In a [report](http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13497 "international health") released just over a year ago, the United States was ranked lowest amongst its peer nations with regard to overall health of the population. To many this is no shock. While we are regarded as one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with some of the best emergency care. We seem to struggle with the most complications, and higher levels of fatality.

Among the most striking of the report's findings are that, among the countries studied, the U.S. has:

* The highest chance that a child will die before age 5
* The second-highest rate of death by [coronary heart disease](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/CPOP/DBASSE_080393#ischaemic-heart-disease)
* The second-highest rate of death by [lung disease](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/CPOP/DBASSE_080393#chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease)
* The highest teen pregnancy rate
* The highest rate of [women dying due to complications](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/CPOP/DBASSE_080393#maternal-conditions-related-to-pregnancy) of pregnancy and childbirth

According to the report these factors held true for all demographics. This meaning, regardless of wealth or lack of insurance the results are similar.

So what are the reasons that Americans are so sick? One of the largest factors has to be what we are eating. The ease of processed foods has overrun our country. There is little left that is natural or organic. Even food products with organic labels only have to meet qualifications set by the FDA to advertise as such. This is just one example of causation.

The bottom line here is that despite our continued implementation of more vaccinations, more drugs, and more aggressive interventions, America is still very sick. If we truly wish to achieve health, we need to stop waiting until we are sick to act. Take control of your life and your health while you are healthy. It is the best and only way to maintain that level.
