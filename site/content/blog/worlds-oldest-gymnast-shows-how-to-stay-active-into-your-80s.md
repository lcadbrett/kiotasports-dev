As we look at the growing population of senior citizens more focus is placed on what is to be done to manage their health rather than to improve it. A recent[](<>) [NPR article](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/14/231451187/exercise-may-help-knees-more-than-glucosamine-and-chondroitin "NPR") talked about how Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis can be treated and even prevented through regular exercise. This has been found to be more effective than popular supplements such as chondroitin and glucosamine. This has been a principle taught at this[](<>) [San Clemente Chiropractic](../index.html "San Clemente Chiropractic") office for some time now. If you keep moving the joints will naturally lubricate and the strength in the muscles will keep the joints mobile and stable.

The videos above and below are of 87 yr old[](<>) [Johanna Quaas of Germany](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/02/johanna-quaas-86-year-old-gymnast-cottbus-world-cup_n_1397152.html "Johanna Quaas"). She was 86 in both of these videos as she demonstrates her amazing strength and talent with her gymnastic performance. Johanna has won 11 senior gymnastic medals and continues to keep herself in great form. She is a wonderful example of the principle that if you never stop taking care of your body, your body will never stop taking care of you.

It is amazing to know that we can continue to enjoy the activities we love if we just don’t ever stop. There are plenty of times where I find myself out surfing with gentlemen who are in this same age range. Yes they may have switched to a longer board and changed their style on the wave but to know that I can surf for the rest of my life is just fabulous!

Don’t let age or nagging injuries stop you from getting the most out of life. Be proactive with your goals and find the support system you need to get back to the level of performance you want. As a[](<>) [chiropractor in San Clemente](../meet-doctors.html "Chiropractor in San Clemente") it is my job to help people reach their health and fitness goals as well as reach new levels of performance. Age should not contribute to your lack of physical activity. It should provide you with more time and more experience to perform.
