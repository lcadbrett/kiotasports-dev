We here at [](<>)[Trestles Chiropractic](../index.html "Trestles Chiropractic") are continually growing and looking to improve the [](<>)[Structural Function](../what-structural-shift.html "structural shift") of the spine the best way we can. Recently we brought on a[](<>)Massage therapist on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We believe that for certain conditions tense muscles and scar tissue build up slow the patient progression towards[](<>) [Structural Correction](../why-structural-chiropractic.html "Structural Correction").

We are currently offering our Structural Massages for Half and Full Hour increments. Let us know if you’d like to schedule a Structural Massage. We are offering single massages or in packages of 5.

Current Patients – Feel free to [message or call us](../ask-doctor.html "contact us") to find out how you can get a complimentary half hour massage.
