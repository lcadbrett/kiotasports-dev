Have you ever stopped to look at the bottom of your work shoes or favorite pair of sneakers? If the answer is Yes, then you may have noticed a difference between the two. Unless the pair is brand new, you probably noticed that one was a bit more worn than the other. So you have to ask yourself, why is this happening?

As a[](<>) [Structural Chiropractor in San Clemente](../index.html "Structural Chiropractor in San Clemente") I observe the heel of the shoe during my examinations and on each follow up visit. I find myself more often than not recommending a new pair of shoes or a visit to the cobbler. Now is a new pair of shoes the solution? No, while it is an important step you must understand that this presentation is a direct result of a Structural abnormality in the spine and pelvis, called Structural Shift.

My primary focus is on the correction of[](<>) [Structural Shift](../what-structural-shift.html "Structural Shirf") in the spine and pelvis. When this occurs we end up with secondary conditions like; a short leg, sciatica, low back pain, IT band syndrome, shin splints, knee and ankle pain, and hip discomfort. When a Structural Shift occurs in the spine or pelvis we see a change in the angle that causes the body weight to be distributed unevenly. This is why the wear seems greater on one side in comparison to the other.

So what can be done when you notice this uneven wear? Obviously a new pair of shoes is an important step however if you wish to extend the life of your sneakers and avoid this from being a recurring issue, a visit to your local[](<>) [Structural Chiropractor](../why-structural-chiropractic.html "structural correction") is what you will need.
