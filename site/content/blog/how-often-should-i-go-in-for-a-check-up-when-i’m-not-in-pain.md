This week I am going to cut straight to the chase. No sugar coating this one. The answer is…

At least once every:

* 6 months if you are a healthy, moderately active individual, or a child/teen under the age of 14.
* 2-3 months if you are sedentary, somewhat healthy, and over the age of 15.
* Month if you are recovering from an injury, completely inactive from exercise, or dealing with chronic injury and symptoms.
* Month if you are very active, play competitive sports with high impact, and understand that it is better to prevent injury rather than waiting to treat it.

Keep in mind this schedule is for the “check-up” if there is a current injury or ailment being addressed a more frequent treatment plan will be recommended.

Being the schedule oriented people that we are. All too often we fail to include ourselves and our personal health in our day to day scheduling. Just like we make our biannual dental appointments, we should be at least setting aside the same time to look at our spine.

Depending on our lifestyle and activity level the recommendations are different for each person. This [](<>)[San Clemente Chiropractor](../index.html "San Clemente Chiropractor") offers a free consultation, or face to face conversation, with all prospective and new patients to determine if Chiropractic is the best choice for you. We also offer No-charge “well check-up” visits for all children under the age of 14. Often in children they are not in need of an adjustment so one will not be given.
