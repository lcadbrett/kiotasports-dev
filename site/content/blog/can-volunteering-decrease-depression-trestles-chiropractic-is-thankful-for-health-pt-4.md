As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday this week it is difficult to not reflect on all that we have and how greatly blessed we are, especially with current world tragedies around us like the disaster in the Philippines. Often we like to focus on the negative that is going on around us and the things we wish were different or we would like to change. Most of the news media is somewhat negative and focuses more on the horrible things around us rather than the uplifting stories and miracles that occur on a daily basis.

Is it no wonder that so many people find themselves suffering from depression and anxiety disorders? The world around us appears to be in complete dismay and sometimes we get lost in all of it. Many who suffer from anxiety often have no reason that even they can attribute their current condition to.

While anxiety and depression come in all different shapes and severities a recent [study](http://www.everydayhealth.com/depression/how-volunteering-can-lessen-depression-and-extend-your-life.aspx "volunteering") by Dr. Suzanne Richards published in the *BMC Public health* in the U.K. has reviewed studies over the past 20 years showing increased health and wellness benefits from volunteering. They found a decrease in depression and anxiety amongst the groups in these studies. Often factors include social connections, pure activity and focusing on serving others.

All too often we become caught up in our own selves and our own problems that we forget just how bad others have it. When we volunteer at a shelter or at a soup kitchen we are reminded of just how good we have it. Our trivial problems seem minuscule in comparison to those who are truly in need. Unfortunately this method wonâ€™t cure every case of depression but for some it may provide some real help.

As a [](<>)[Chiropractor in San Clemente](../meet-doctors.html "Chiropractor in San Clemente") I am proud to announce that we will be giving back to children in need this Holiday season as we are set up as a Toys For Tots drop site through December 16th. So please feel free to come in and drop off an unwrapped toy to help those in need.

[](<>)[Trestles Chiropractic](../index.html "Trestles Chiropractic") is also having a[](<>) [Holiday Raffle](../raffle.html "Holiday Raffle") in conjunction with the toy drive. We will be raffling off a 16 GB iPod Nano and 5 others will win a movie pass. Tickets are given for donating a toy, getting an Adjustment and referring a friend or family member to Trestles Chiropractic.
