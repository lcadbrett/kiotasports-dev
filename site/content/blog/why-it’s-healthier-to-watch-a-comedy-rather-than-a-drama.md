To this day the leading cause of death in the U.S. is Heart Disease. The number one trigger to heart disease is stress. Structural stress in particular can wreak havoc on your body and your nervous system

When we are stressed our bodies release a hormone called Cortisol. This particular hormone suppresses bodily functions such as: immune response, digestion, urinary, and bowel. This also leads to fatigue, irritability, and tension.

When we smile and/or laugh our body releases endorphins which stop the release of cortisol in the body. This allows for regular functionality of the body to resume. It also relaxes you and helps you to unwind.

Many of the structural changes I see in my office come from emotional and physical stressors. It is important to find effective ways to combat stress. So, the next time you’ve had a rough day or week turn on a comedy and get some good laughs to help you decrease those levels of cortisol.
