I usually spend a little bit of time checking on my SEO in the mornings before the day gets busy with patients. Today I came across something I found interesting. A colleague of mine was using the title “Best Chiropractor in San Clemente” as the name of a video about his practice. The first thing that came to my mind was the legality of this statement. So I found my way to the [Better Business Bureau](http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-code-of-advertising/#Do "BBB") website and found that my impression of “Superiority Claims” was in fact accurate.

The Truth is this is a completely subjective statement. There may be one patient that loves the way I treat their complaint and another who may not feel the same way. If there is one thing that I have learned in my experience as a Doctor of Chiropractic it is that the Doctor is not the most important part of the equation. My goal at [Trestles Chiropractic](http://www.trestleschiropractic.com "Trestles Chiropractic") is to allow the body to do the healing. My level of expertise is such that I am able to identify those areas of dysfunction and aide in the body’s natural process of recovery.

In my opinion claims of superiority in professional areas are unnecessary as they can never be completely substantiated. My hope is that as members of the general public we seek to find those who display the upmost integrity and strive to help those around them and truly serve because it is their passion. Those are the individuals in the health care industry who have you in their best interest.
