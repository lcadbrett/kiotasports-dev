We're keeping the season going strong with a special give away for the first 600 in attendance as we watch the 2016 Tritons take on Palos Verdes Friday Sept 23rd. Stop by the [](<>)[Trestles Chiropractic](http://trestleschiropractic.com/why-structural-chiropractic.html "Structural Shift") Booth at the main gate and receive your own Tritons rally towel. We are proud to be a sponsor of the 2016 Tritons. Please stop by and say hello.

Be sure to get to the game early as we only have a limited number of towels. If you are unable to attend and would like to pick one up from the office we will have a limited number available for any interested.

**GO TRITONS!**
