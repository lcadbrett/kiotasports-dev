Well folks the 5-1 SC Tritons are gearing up for Friday night's Homecoming Game. If you thought the crowning of the King and Queen was enough, think again. As a proud sponsor of the 2014 Tritons We have partnered with the Varsity Cheer team to toss out Free Limited Edition 50th anniversary Shirts!

The Magic will take place in the 3rd Quarter so be sure to be back in your seats and ready to flag down one of the Cheerleaders in hopes of them tossing a shirt your way. There is a limited number so you may want to get there early to ensure that you have a good position.

See you Friday Night!

**GO TRITONS!**
