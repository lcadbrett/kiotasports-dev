Often I have heard pregnant patients complain of the discomfort they are feeling not only from the changes in their bodies but from the need to adapt to new sleeping positions. Especially as they get later on in their pregnancy it becomes more difficult to find positions to get and stay comfortable in. Some positions such as lying on their stomachs have been determined to be dangerous as the baby is developing in the womb.

I mentioned in a previous post about how I help[](<>) [pregnant women](san-clemente-chiropractor-helps-women-during-pregnancy.html "Pregnancy Chiropractor"), as a[](<>) [chiropractor in San Clemente](../meet-doctors.html "Chiropractor in San Clemente"). Pregnant women are more susceptible to spinal and pelvic misalignments due to the hormones being released to cause their ligaments to become more lax in preparation for delivery.

Here at [](<>)[Trestles Chiropractic](../index.html "Trestles Chiropractic") we not only strive to uplift and help people reach their health and wellness goals but also do so with the right technique and equipment. The specialized treatment table that I use allows for women to lie on their stomachs as the mid section can be locked out of the way and the low back raised to allow for enough room on any patient. The table is also equipped with a hydraulic lift that allows the patient to not have to struggle getting up and down off of the table.

So if you find yourself tired, uncomfortable, and ready for some positive change, it may be time to[](<>) [Contact us](../ask-doctor.html "contact us"). Especially with the new patient special we currently have it will be well worth it!

Finally, this is the last week of the [Holiday Raffle](../raffle.html "Holiday Raffle") where you can win an iPod nano. The drawing will be Thursday, December 19that 6:00 PM.
