If you were to walk into a coffee shop on any given morning and ask for a raise of hands from those who have taken their children to the dentist you’d probably receive a strong result in the affirmative. However, ask the same question with regard to a[](<>) [Chiropractor](../meet-doctors.html "San Clemente Chiropractor") visit and the result would be much different. Many have questioned the need for Pediatric chiropractic care because they associate chiropractic care with pain relief only and not the relief of other systemic problems and or preventative care. As a child is growing it is so vital that the nervous system and the spine are supported to promote healthy growth and proper postural support.

One specific condition that chiropractors have had success with is [](<>)**[infantile colic](http://www.earthmamaangelbaby.com/mama-resources/expert-panel/dr-cheryl-l-schmitt/can-chiropractic-care-help-my-colicky-baby "infantile colic")**. Colic usually presents between 2-3 weeks of age and can last up to 4 months with its peak around 2 months of age. Symptoms usually consist of tight muscles, red appearance, balling up in the fetal position, and of course fretful, inconsolable cries. No cause has been determined in the medical community for colic. However, every mother knows when her child has it.

Some common methods of calming the child are swaddling, distraction, rocking, massage, and pharmaceutical interventions. Often a mother will never think to pay a visit to a Pediatric Chiropractor to check the child’s spine and nervous system for tension and possible restriction to nerve flow. As babies can not speak they are limited to one method of letting you know there is a problem and the of course is crying. As an adult when you feel a pinch or tightness in your back it’s easy to let someone know what the problem is. As described above this is not the case for your infant.

Numerous[](<>) [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21571236 "chiropractic research") have shown that gentle chiropractic adjustments to an infant can reduce the frequency, duration and severity of infant colic after only 2-3 adjustments. The key word to recognize is “gentle.” Sometimes when an adult receives an adjustment it can seem strong. With children and especially infants the adjustment is extremely light as there is not much muscle tone to resist the motion into the spine as well as the softness of the spinal structures that allow them to move easily. Many times A child or infant will be adjusted in their parents arms to help them see just how light and small the motion and force is that is required to treat a child.
