Just today it was announced that more suspensions were given by Major League Baseball for use of [Performance Enhancing Drugs](http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/major-league-baseball-alex-rodriguez-ped-use-080513). Most of these players have accepted 50 game suspensions without pay. Most will lose sponsorships during this time and may never quite return to the spotlight as in the case of Manny Ramirez.

As I look at the reasons most players choose to use these performance enhancers there are several goals that the athlete wishes to achieve. These include: More Power/strength, Speed, Agility, Less prone to injury, Faster results with training and obviously more money. Some of these young players see PEDs as a way to burst into the scene while other veteran players see them as a means to continue to get good contracts and fill the park with loyal fans.

Obviously the days of getting away with PED use has come and gone. So how can these athletes achieve the same goals without the use of PEDs? I submit that rather than trying to improve the body from the outside in they do it from the inside out. Feed the body what it needs, Grow the body in the way it was designed, and take care of your nervous system. Chiropractic care CAN AND WILL help the body to function at its maximum potential by allowing the nervous system to function without any impedance.
