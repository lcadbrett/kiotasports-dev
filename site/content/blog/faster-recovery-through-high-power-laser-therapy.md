I would like to introduce you to the newest service offered at[](<>) [Trestles Chiropractic](http://trestleschiropractic.com/index.html "Trestles Chiropractic") in the form of[](<>) High Power Laser Therapy. Each January I reflect over the past year to see areas where I can improve my care and effectiveness in offering the best, and most up to date[](<>) [Structural Correction](http://trestleschiropractic.com/why-structural-chiropractic.html "Structural Correction") possible. Last year my main focus was on improving my ability to monitor patient progress which greatly helped me to personalize my care plans to the individual needs. However, as I reflected on my 2015 there was room for improvement.

Many patients came to me with neck, low back, and pelvic issues. I felt that we had great success in correcting the structural shifts found in those cases which resulted in decreased pain and improvement in range of motion and increased activity. Others presented with extremity discomfort. Often times in these cases damaged muscle, tendon, or ligaments are responsible for the structural shift. There was room for improvement in this area of my care. While many found relief, often times the road to recovery is quite lengthy for these conditions as the healing process is slowed by our continued use of these extremities.

After months of research, and an in office trial, I have brought in a 30 watt[](<>)Therapy Laser into the practice. The current research has shown that this type of Laser speeds up the rate of healing by 300%. Allowing for us to reach our goals at a faster rate. Essentially the laser uses a specific wavelength of light energy to saturate the treatment area. This provides the body with necessary resources and energy to efficiently do its job of healing the damaged tissue. The procedure takes 5-10 min on average and is consistent with my therapeutic goals of healing without the use of drugs or surgery. Most patients reported feeling warmth or a tingling sensation during treatment.

My in office trial saw a 76% reduction of symptoms after just one treatment. The participants had injuries ranging from shoulder, knee, ankle, low back, hip, and several other areas. We had an even spread of new and old injuries.

I myself used the laser on an old high ankle sprain that I suffered about a year ago. I was not one of those who saw immediate results. It wasnâ€™t until the 4th treatment that I felt a decrease in pain and saw my weight distribution drop from 25lbs on the right down to 17lbs.

I will not be recommending[](<>) Laser therapy for every patient as it is not indicated for such. Here is a list of conditions that you would want to talk to me about if you are currently experiencing problems in these areas.
