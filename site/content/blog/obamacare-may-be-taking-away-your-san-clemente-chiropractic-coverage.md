It has been a very difficult time for many physicians over the years as the insurance game has grown more and more restrictive and competitive. However, with the new affordable health care act many had hoped to see an end to the lack of coverage. Part of the problem is the lack of TRUE HEALTHCARE knowledge in Washington. If you look at the [sections of preventative medicine](http://obamacarefacts.com/benefitsofobamacare.php "obamacare benefits"), where services like chiropractic and acupuncture should be found, you will find only screening services and vaccinations. The Service of acupuncture is only found under “[essential benefits](http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/07/15/second-opinion-does-obamacare-cover-acupuncture-and-chiropractors/ "essential benefits")” and is only acceptable for certain conditions. Chiropractic on the other hand is not to be found. In fact the only coverage is included for those with medicare part B who will only keep their limited chiropractic benefits.

As a[](<>) [Chiropractor in San Clemente](http://www.trestleschiropractic.com/meet-doctor "Chiropractor in San Clemente") California this has come as a bit of a disappointment. I was hopeful at first that the administration would be more open to alternative therapies and the ability of the people to seek care the can help prevent serious injury and disease.

So what does this mean for you? This ultimately means that you will see an [increase in the cost](are-you-ready-increased-healthcare-costs.html "increased healthcare cost") of your chiropractic care if you do not have a supplemental insurance in place. Most chiropractors charge anywhere between $45-70 for an office visit. That can add up if an extensive treatment plan is needed for an injury or for corrective care for postural issues such as a forward head posture.
