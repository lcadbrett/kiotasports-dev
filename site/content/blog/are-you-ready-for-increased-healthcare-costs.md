If you have an insurance plan younger than 3 years old you may have received a letter like the picture in the slideshow above. This may have come as a shock to those who had thought they were all set and ready for the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare to take effect. Sadly these newer plans are non-compliant with the ACA and you will be forced to apply for a new plan that will be available after October 1st 2013. In most cases these newer plans are estimated to be **50-75% higher** than what your premium was previously. For many folks that turns what was once a $150 PPO plan into **$262.50 monthly premium** for a similar plan and benefits.

With the way the economy is today even residents of San Clemente and other cities in South Orange County may not have it in their budget for **an extra $1350 per year** in healthcare expenses.

For most people Health insurance is a very expensive monthly service that they buy into and yet have little to no idea what kind of coverage they actually have. So many individuals have no clue what a deducible is let alone what services are actually covered and how many visits are allowed if they have coverage. Luckily for you I have got a guy!
