Have you ever gotten to the end of the work day only to find that you have a pounding headache? Or maybe your boss or co-worker was talking to you and you immediately forgot everything they just said. If you find yourself feeling like a zombie by the end of the day you are most certainly [DEHYDRATED](http://nutritioninfo.tripod.com/id19.html "dehydration"). As corporate athletes it is just as important to have proper hydration. We all know that the body is made up of about 75% water. However, did you know that in the process of dehydration the brain is one of the first areas the body removes water from to supply the rest of the body?

This would explain why you feel that inability to concentrate or that stabbing headache. You may also think that those fruity drinks, coffee, tea and sodas are keeping you hydrated. The truth is that many of these drinks do contain water but also contain chemicals and substances that donâ€™t allow the body to hold onto the water you are taking in. The best ways to stay hydrated are of course to drink at least 8 oz of water per-day as well as keep [fruits and berries](http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/08/11/foods-that-keep-hydrated/ "dehydration") in your diet as they are made up of about 90% water.

Not only is the brain a main source of dehydration. The discs in our spine also contain about 90% water. As gravity weighs down on us each day, water is pushed out of the disc. Then when we sleep at night or visit our local Chiropractor, the discs are allowed to draw in more water and return to their thick, healthy state. This reduces compression on the nerves as well as improves posture and muscle function.
